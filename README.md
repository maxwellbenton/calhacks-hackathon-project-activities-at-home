## At Home Substitute

**At Home Substitute** is an app built for parents who find themselves trying to balance childcare and working from home. This app provides a way for a parent to quickly and easily set up a series of activities for a child to do, letting the parent guide what their child spends their time on while choosing how involved they'd like to be.

**At Home Substitute** is built using React and client-side storage, so there is no server involved but data is still persisted. It is hosted on Firebase and uses YouTubeâ€™s data API.
